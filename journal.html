My animation is linked to my projects page on my website. It was difficult to get started on making the animation but I am happy that it works well!

My code sketch works because when you click somewhere on the page, you are clicking on an x and y intercept for where the menorah should show up. There is a div in my code that uses javascript to allow this to happen. In javascript, a variable is an identifier for a value. You can assign values to variables so that you do not have to repeat the value multiple times in a code. Strings are the letters and symbols that make up a language. Lastly, in javascript, a string is a series of characters.

An event listener helps to program a code so that when you click on certain x and y coordinates on a page, something can happen.
