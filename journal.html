<h1> Caroline's Journal
<h2> Journal Entry #1 - 11/13
For my code sketch, I created a Hanukkah themed sketch. I used javascript to make a menorah appear wherever you click on the page, and it says happy hanukkah at the top. I am getting used to javascript and it is becoming easier to create codes using it. 

<h3> Journal Entry #2 - 11/16
For my music.html project, I created a code that uses an event listener to change the color on the screen from blue to pink when you click on it. It is also coded so that when I added an audio file, it only appears on the odd click. 


<h4> Journal Entry #3 - 12/1
For the square quilt project, the code uses javascript to make a function with the input of x and styling techinques in order for the outline of squares to appear on the page. I edited the code to make each box appear green, and when you click on the boxes, a picture appears. It is coded with i+i=1 so that each time the function runs, it adds 1.


<h5> Journal Entry #4 - 12/12
For my array project, I created a code that generates gifts. The event listener in the code is what allows for the gift to appear when the box is clicked on and the gifts are defined as var gifts and are linked as images. Math.round makes numbers rounded to a number between 1 and 5 when the box is clicked on. When one of these numbers appears, an image appears along with it.
